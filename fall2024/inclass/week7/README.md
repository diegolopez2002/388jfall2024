# Directions
- Replace `static/custom.css` and `templates/base.html` in your Project 2 with the files provided in this repository.

- Add [cat.png](cat.png) to your `static` folder as well.

### You are encouraged to play around with the values in `custom.css` to see how they affect the appearance of your website, add more elements to `base.html`, and add more CSS rules to `custom.css` as well :)
